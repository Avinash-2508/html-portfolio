<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Avinash Ponneboina, a Computer Science student at SRM University with a passion for coding and solving
  complex problems. I’m always eager to learn and improve myself, continuously sharpening my skills. I’m proficient in
  Python and C, and I’m continuing to build my knowledge in Java.
</p>
<p>For me, learning never stops. I believe that continuous growth is the key to success, and I’m always on the lookout
  for new opportunities to challenge myself. I enjoy spending time with friends who inspire and support me because 
  I believe the right people can push you to become your best self.</p>

<p>Apart from coding, I love traveling and exploring nature. There’s something refreshing about being outdoors that 
  keeps me motivated. I value productivity and can’t stand laziness—I believe that consistent effort is what truly makes
  a difference.</p>
<p>I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and turning ideas into reality.</p>
